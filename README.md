# Hey, I'm Oli!

I'm a Swedish student of information technology with a passion for code and understanding.
I experiment with all sorts of bits and bobs, typically involving a healthy amount of programming.
Here's some of the things I do:

🔌 [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) plugin development in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) (prev. [Java](https://www.java.com).)  
💻 Front-end website development using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  
⚡ Back-end and API:s using [Express](https://expressjs.com). *I also know PHP but don't use it much.*  
🐧 [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com) servers.  
🐍 Utility and QoL [Python](https://www.python.org) and [AHK](https://www.autohotkey.com) scripts used to automate tasks.  
🖨 3D-printing on my [Ender 3 Neo](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/ender-3-neo).  
🎨 Graphic design in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator).  
🔮 Minecraft [data packs](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Data_pack), commands and resource packs.  

My text editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), but I also use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) when programming in Kotlin or Java.
