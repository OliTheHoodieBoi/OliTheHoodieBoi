# Hey, I'm Oli!

I'm a Swedish student of information technology with a passion for code and understanding.
I experiment with all sorts of bits and bobs, typically involving a healthy amount of programming.
Here's some of the things I do:

🔌 [PaperMC](https://papermc.io) plugin development in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org) (prev. [Java](https://www.java.com).)  
💻 Full stack website development using JavaScript, HTML and CSS.  
⚡ Web apps and API:s in [Express](https://expressjs.com).  
🐧 [Ubuntu Linux](https://ubuntu.com) server programming.  
🐍 Utility and QoL Python scripts used to automate tasks.  
🖨 3D-printing on my [Ender 3 Neo](https://www.creality3dofficial.com/products/ender-3-neo).  
🎨 Graphic design in [Adobe Illustrator](https://www.adobe.com/products/illustrator).  
🔮 Minecraft data packs, commands and resource packs.  

My text editor of choice is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com), but I also use [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea) when programming in Kotlin or Java.
